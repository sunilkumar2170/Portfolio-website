# My Professional Portfolio
This is my Personal Portfolio Website, showcasing my skills and experience. It includes sections like Introduction, Skills (Data & DevOps), Resume, and Contact with interactive LinkedIn, GitHub, and email buttons. The site is fully responsive and visually appealing. Additionally, it integrates an AI Chatbot (using open-source LLM) to answer queries about my resume, skills, projects, and certifications. Hosted on Netlify & GitHub Pages for accessibility.
